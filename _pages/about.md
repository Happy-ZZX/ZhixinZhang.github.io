I'm a PhD student from [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.manchester.ac.uk/), [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My research interests include Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Visual Inertial aided Navigation Systems (VINS), Sensor Fusion, and State estimation. I got my Bachelor's degree from Henan University, China (2020), and a Master's degree from the University of Manchester (2022) with a distinguished level(<10%). Now I am a member of UOM Applied Vision and Robotic Lab under the supervision of Dr.Pawel Ladosz.
